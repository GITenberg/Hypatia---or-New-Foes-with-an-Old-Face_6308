description: "Hypatia, or New Foes with an Old Face is an 1853 novel by the English\
  \ writer Charles Kingsley. It is a fictionalised account of the life of the philosopher\
  \ Hypatia, and tells the story of a young monk called Philammon who travels to Alexandria,\
  \ where he becomes mixed up in the political and religious battles of the day. Although\
  \ intended as Christian apologia, the novel has a deliberate anti-Catholic tone,\
  \ and it also reflects Kingsley's other prejudices about race and religion, many\
  \ of which were typical to the 19th century. For many years the book was considered\
  \ one of Kingsley's best novels and was widely read.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
